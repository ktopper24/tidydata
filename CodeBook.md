x_train: a text file that contains the variable measurements of all the training subjectss

train_set: reads in the x_train data and stores the data

y_train: a text file containing the labels of the activity performed for the observation

train_labels: reads in y_train and stores the activity labels

subject_train: a text file that contains the subject number of each observation

train_subject: reads in the train_labels text file and stores the subject labels

train: is a dat frame that combines both the acivity labels and the subject labels with the measured variables

features: this is a the labels for every column in the train and set data sets that correspond to each variable measured

All of these text files and variables apply to the test data as well, with the corresponding test names.

all_data: is a combination of the train and test data sets with the train at the beginning and test added to the end

needed_columns: this is a vector of the numbers of the columns that take the mean or standard deviation of measurements

needed_after: this is the vector needed_columns with 2 added to every number to compensate for ID columns that have
been added to the beginning of the data frame

needed_data: a data frame with all observations included, but only that columns that are needed (means and standard
deviations

melted: a melted version of the needed_data frame

data: a data frame that displays the mean of each variable for each subject ID and activity ID
